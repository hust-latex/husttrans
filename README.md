>   中文版[点击这里](https://github.com/hust-latex/husttrans/blob/master/README.zh-cn.md)。

An Unofficial Translation Template in LaTeX for [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://www.hust.edu.cn). See other templates in <http://hust-latex.github.io>.

## Requirement

* Install the latest version of [TeXLive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)(Recommend) or [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/). Please ensure that all the packages are up-to-date.
* Install following Chinese fonts:
    * `AdobeSongStd-Light`
    * `AdobeKaitiStd-Regular`
    * `AdobeHeitiStd-Regular`
    * `AdobeFangsongStd-Regular`

## Installation

### Install into local

Use the command below to install this template into local.
```
make install
```
If you need uninstall it, use the command below.
```
make uninstall
```

For Windows User who don't install `Make`, use the command below to install.
```
makewin32.bat install
```
If you need uninstall it, use the command below.
```
makewin32.bat uninstall
```
Although `makewin32.bat` behaves much like `Makefile`, I still recommend you install `Make` into your Windows. You can download it from [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).

### Use without installation

If you want to use this template temporary rather than installing it into local for long term use. Run below command to unpack the package.
```
make unpack
```
For Windows User who don't install `Make`, use the command below to unpack the package.
```
makewin32.bat unpack
```
Then copy following files from directory `husttrans` into your TeX project root directory:
* `husttrans.cls`

## Usage

**Important : This template can only be compiled by XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX[Recommend].**
